=================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-EasyInstall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-EasyInstall)

[Easy Install] is a module for [Omeka Semantic] that allows to install Omeka S
modules and themes from https://omeka.org and from the web (https://github.com
and https://gitlab.com).

The idea comes from the plugin [Escher] for [Omeka Classic].

See more details on [modules] and [themes].

------------

Uncompress files in the directory `modules` and rename folder `EasyInstall`.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module](http://dev.omeka.org/docs/s/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules).


Usage
-----

Simply select either the desired module or the desired theme and click "upload".


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup and to check your files and database regularly
so you can roll back if needed.
